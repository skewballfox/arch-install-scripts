# Arch install scripts

## Description

This automates the building/recreation of my current setup in arch, both in terms of downloaded packages and in terms of changes I have made to the setup. It also serves as a form of documentation that I can refer to when trying to see what changes I have made to my system.

## TODO

use global environment variables to pass options between scripts

setup a few useful Virtual Machines

Migrate to a custom Kernel

use tmux to daemonize termite

figure out how to update rsync server list in powerpill config

explore battery saving options

make the partition management a bit more flexible

Find a way to sandbox x11 for Firefox while retaining the ability to control the window shape via i3wm (qubes managed to do this with xen virtualization)
