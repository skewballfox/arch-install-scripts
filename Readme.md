# Arch install scripts

## Description

This is a collection of scripts that I use to go recreate my current setup in arch, both in terms of downloaded packages and in terms of changes I have made to the setup. It also serves as a form of Documentation that I can refer to when trying to see what changes I have made to my system.

## TODO

mv automata and systemd units to another repository, mainly because I think that's outside of the scope of what this is for. 

automate the process, so that I don't have to run each script individually. 

prompt user for username, password, hostname, etc.

use global environment variables to pass options between scripts

break down the i3 and sway build into two seperate scripts, one containing packages, and one containing system changes

perhaps move from a long as string to an array for the package list

perhaps use selenium to automate the login process for initializing the gdrive sync
