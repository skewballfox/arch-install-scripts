# Arch install scripts

## Description

This automates the initial setup of arch. I recently cleaned it up and stripped out a lot of what it previously did. This is mainly setting up a slightly hardened base system. My plan is to move most of the user level packages and configuration to an ansible build

## TODO

condense more, implement error catching and logging

mv optimal block size check into installer itself

figure out how to update rsync server list in powerpill config

make the partition management a bit more flexible
