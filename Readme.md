# Arch install scripts

## Description

This automates the building/recreation of my current setup in arch, both in terms of downloaded packages and in terms of changes I have made to the setup. It also serves as a form of documentation that I can refer to when trying to see what changes I have made to my system.

## TODO

prompt user for username, password, hostname, etc.

use global environment variables to pass options between scripts

setup at least partially automated partition management

setup a few useful Virtual Machines

Migrate to a custom Kernel

setup global.local firejail rules to enable apparmor support

use tmux to daemonize termite
