# Arch install scripts

## Description

This automates the building/recreation of my current setup in arch, both in terms of downloaded packages and in terms of changes I have made to the setup. It also serves as a form of documentation that I can refer to when trying to see what changes I have made to my system.

## TODO

setup a few useful Virtual Machines

Migrate to a custom Kernel

parse through powerstrap, document, and add aur package options

condense most of the code to one script, implement documentation and logging, make package installation more flexible

make most necessary filechanges on arch-usb, then transfer to chroot

mv optimal block size check into installer itself

implement logging to catch possible errors and misteps

look into and implement compilation flags for certain packages ( considering trying to get native performance for electron. )

use tmux to daemonize termite

figure out how to update rsync server list in powerpill config

explore battery saving options

make the partition management a bit more flexible
